## CipherHub: Simple Encryption/Decryption Tool ##
CipherHub is a web-based tool that lets you easily encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher technique. This method shifts each letter in the text by a certain number of positions in the alphabet. The tool is built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## How to Use ##
